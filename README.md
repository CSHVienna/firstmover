### Abstract
Mounting evidence suggests that STEM fields (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) suffer from gender biases. In this paper, we study the physics community, a discipline where women are still under-represented and gender disparities persist. To reveal such inequalities, we perform a paper matching analysis using a robust statistical similarity metric. Our analyses indicate that womenâ€™s papers tend to have lower visibility in the citation network, a phenomenon significantly influenced by the temporal aspects of scientific production. Within pairs of similar papers, the author that publishes first tends to obtain more citations. By controlling for publication date, the gender disparity among first and last authors decreases by 31% and 15%, respectively. From the group perspective, men have cumulative historical advantages due to women joining the field later and at a slower rate. Therefore, the first-mover advantage plays a crucial role in the emergence of gender disparities in the physics community.
